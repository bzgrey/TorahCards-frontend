A rabbinical student is studying the laws of the Jewish Sabbath (*Shabbos*) and he has an examination coming up on these laws that will help him gain his ordination as a rabbi. He opens up TorahCards, signs in, and clicks on the "create note". He pastes his notes into the content box" and the name "Laws of Shabbos" to create flashcards on the laws of the Sabbath. He then clicks on "convert to flashcards", and a bunch of flashcards are produced, taking him to the flashcard viewing/editing page, where he can now review by testing himself on the flashcards, flipping them from question to answer.
